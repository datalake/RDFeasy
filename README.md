RDFeasy is a software distribution that consists of

1) An operating system (Ubuntu 13.10)
2) A database (OpenLink Virtuoso 7)
3) A collection of scripts to partially automate the process of loading data into said database and capturing the database instance in a virtual machine image (now an Amazon AMI)

The system as a whole embodies considerable experience in the loading process and is designed to fit the requirements for listing on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace).
