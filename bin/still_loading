# The grep matches if there is a line with nothing but a 0 on it,  which
# is what we get if there are no files in an undone state;  with the -c
# option we count how many we zeros we see,  this should be 0 or 1.  The
# awk statement does logical negation so we get '1' if there are files
# left to load or '0' if there are not or something else if there are not
# files to load
